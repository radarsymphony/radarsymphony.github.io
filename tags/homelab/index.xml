This approach enables you to manage your own zone(s) for local services running in a Home Lab. It may also help cache DNS queries to reduce lookup time for frequently requested resources. I&amp;rsquo;ve only tested this approach in protected local networks.
Prerequisites Docker &amp;amp; docker-compose Raspberry Pi (optional*) Static IP for Pi (reserved in your DHCP server/router) * You could host this on a personal computer.</description></item><item><title>Traefik Reverse Proxy</title><link>https://knightsdata.com/posts/traefik-reverse-proxy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 18:38:41 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://knightsdata.com/posts/traefik-reverse-proxy/</guid><description>Overview The following guide outlines the steps to run Traefik with docker as a reverse proxy for your host. This setup enables you to resolve hostnames to particular containers running on the host. With a public domain, you can use Traefik to request SSL certificates to enable https for each site.
Prerequisites Public domain (I use &amp;ldquo;example.com&amp;rdquo; throughout, so update these examples with your domain) Docker Docker Compose DNS Setup To allow Traefik to request SSL certificates, you will need to generate an API key with your DNS provider and identify the email associated with that account.</description></item></channel></rss>
