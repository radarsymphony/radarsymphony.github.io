It uses a free ubuntu VPS from the Oracle Cloud Free Tier, but any linux-based host with public IP and about ~1GB of memory should work for small Home Lab setups.
Headscale is an opensource reverse-engineered implementation of the closed source Tailscale coordination server. There are many advantages to using the original Tailscale coordination server, such as a convenient admin panel and multiple tailnets.</description></item><item><title>Tailscale Mesh VPN</title><link>https://knightsdata.com/posts/tailscale-mesh-vpn/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 13:47:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://knightsdata.com/posts/tailscale-mesh-vpn/</guid><description>Overview Tailscale is an easy to configure mesh VPN. It uses NAT traversal to connect peers to each other. This article will outline the steps to set up Tailscale running in Docker as if it were running on the docker host directly (without SSH over the VPN - yet). This approach enables managing the Tailscale connection as you would any other docker service and creates a portable and deploy-able compose.yml to run on other systems.</description></item></channel></rss>
