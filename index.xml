This approach enables you to manage your own zone(s) for local services running in a Home Lab. It may also help cache DNS queries to reduce lookup time for frequently requested resources. I&amp;rsquo;ve only tested this approach in protected local networks.
Prerequisites Docker &amp;amp; docker-compose Raspberry Pi (optional*) Static IP for Pi (reserved in your DHCP server/router) * You could host this on a personal computer.</description></item><item><title>Traefik Reverse Proxy</title><link>https://knightsdata.com/posts/traefik-reverse-proxy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 18:38:41 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://knightsdata.com/posts/traefik-reverse-proxy/</guid><description>Overview The following guide outlines the steps to run Traefik with docker as a reverse proxy for your host. This setup enables you to resolve hostnames to particular containers running on the host. With a public domain, you can use Traefik to request SSL certificates to enable https for each site.
Prerequisites Public domain (I use &amp;ldquo;example.com&amp;rdquo; throughout, so update these examples with your domain) Docker Docker Compose DNS Setup To allow Traefik to request SSL certificates, you will need to generate an API key with your DNS provider and identify the email associated with that account.</description></item><item><title>How To Set Up This Blog</title><link>https://knightsdata.com/posts/set-up-this-blog/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Feb 2023 18:00:23 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://knightsdata.com/posts/set-up-this-blog/</guid><description>Overview This guide outlines the steps required to create a minimal blog like this one. This blog leverages Github Pages and Hugo to render markdown pages as blog posts and apply the Gokarna theme.
The steps will begin with setting up an account on github.com and run through to deploying the site via a github workflow. I may create another post about adding the ability for your readers to comment on a post.</description></item></channel></rss>
